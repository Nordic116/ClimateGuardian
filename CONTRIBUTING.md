   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Install development dependencies
   pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8 mypy
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your credentials (optional for basic development)
   ```

4. **Initialize Development Data**
   ```bash
   python scripts/initialize_datasets.py
   ```

5. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Format code with black
black app.py scripts/ tests/

# Check style with flake8
flake8 app.py scripts/ tests/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy app.py
```

### Testing
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Test both success and error cases
- Use descriptive test names

```bash
# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/test_app.py::test_health_check
```
